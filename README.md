# About Me

Hello! I'm Jos√© Castillo, a self-taught developer from Mexico, passionate about technology and creativity. Currently, I'm focused on learning FullStack web development with JavaScript and Python on my own, in search of new learning opportunities and professional growth.

My journey in technology started in 2022, where I discovered my passion for the programming world. Since then, I've been learning and improving my skills on my own. Besides FullStack web development with JavaScript and Python, I also have skills in graphic design, digital marketing, and basic knowledge in HTML and CSS.

I'm committed to continue improving and developing my skills in the technology field. I'm seeking new opportunities to apply my knowledge and learn from experienced professionals.
